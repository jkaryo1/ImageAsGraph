Part I - Graph Implementation 

--------------------------------------------//

Part 1 was relatively easy as all we had to do was 
slightly alter the GraphAdjMatrix.java implementation
and make it use an  adjacency/incidence list. We chose 
to use a hashmap list that holds a vertex and a Linked List
of Edges incident to the vertex that are inserted in order. 
We originally used an array list to store our incident edges,
but thought that a linked list would be more efficient, 
especially so because we chose to store our edges ordered.
We all worked and tested each others' code so it is hard 
to say who exactly did what.
